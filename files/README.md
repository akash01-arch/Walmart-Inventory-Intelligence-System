## 📌 Project Overview

This project evolved in **two versions** — starting from a thorough exploratory data analysis of Walmart's inventory data, then upgraded to a full **production-grade ML system** with demand forecasting, stockout risk prediction, revenue forecasting, and inventory optimization.

> **Business Problem:** Walmart's existing forecasting system has ~18% MAPE error, causing significant revenue loss from stockouts and excess capital locked in overstock. This project replaces it with an ML-driven approach.

## 📊 Version 1 — EDA & Business Insights
> `Walmart-Inventory-Analysis.ipynb`

A comprehensive exploratory analysis answering 22 real business questions:

| Analysis Area | Key Finding |
|--------------|-------------|
| Revenue Analysis | Electronics generates 52% of total revenue ($7.94M) |
| Inventory vs Demand | Correlation = 0.003 → Inventory NOT aligned with demand |
| Forecast Accuracy | 18.4% forecast error → Poor planning model |
| Stockout Impact | $752K higher revenue during stockout periods (peak demand) |
| Lost Revenue | $359M lost due to under-forecasting |
| Excess Inventory | $343M tied up due to over-forecasting |
| Customer Retention | 74.9% one-time buyers → Major retention opportunity |
| Store Performance | $374K revenue gap between best and worst store |

**Skills Demonstrated:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Business KPI Analysis, Data Storytelling
